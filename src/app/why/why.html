            <h3>Why MCPR?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You might ask, "why would we need ANOTHER plugin registry..." The simple answer is because this one will have a robust API
                and it will also get plugins from the most popular plugin registries such as BukkitDev and Spigot Resources,
                along with the plugins that it contains! Another reason that this plugin registry is better is because it
                actually has a CLI! That's where the Go CLI comes in. With the CLI you can easily setup a Minecraft server
                and install plugins with only a few commands!
            </p>
            <h4>Robust API</h4>
            <p>MCPR has a robust API! The API will allow developers to integrate the registry into their plugins! For example,
                <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/jpanel" target="_blank">JPanel</a> is a nice Minecraft control panel
                plugin but you know what would make it even better? An interface that allows you to search and install plugins
                without ever leaving the panel! How awesome would that be???</p>

            <h4>Plugins From BukkitDev and Spigot Resources</h4>
            <p>You can search and install plugins from BukkitDev and Spigot Resources with MCPR! That makes MCPR the one place
                where you can find almost all Bukkit/Spigot plugins! You can also get BukkitDev and Spigot Resources plugins
                with the API. That means developers only have to intergrate with one API to get plugins from three sources!</p>

            <h4>MC-CLI</h4>
            <p>MCPR has a CLI! With the CLI you can easily setup a Minecraft server and install plugins with only a few commands!</p>
