## How to contribute to MCPR

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in MCPR**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mcpr/mcpr/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mcpr/mcpr/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [MCPR Slack Group](https://slack.mcpr.io) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use MCPR in the [MCPR Slack Group](https://slack.mcpr.io).
